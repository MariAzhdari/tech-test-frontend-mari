# Moonpig React App 

## Introduction

The goal is to create a simple page that displays a list of cards from the Moonpig API. The project is developed using React and integrates features such as card listings, card details, and navigation.


## Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks:

.React
.React Router DOM
.Other dependencies (check package.json)


## Setup:

1.Clone the repository.
2.Install dependencies with npm install.
3.Start the development server with npm start.



## Running the Application:

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.




## Project Structure:

.App.js: Main component defining the React application and routing.
.HomePage.js: Component for displaying a list of cards.
.EachCardPage.js: Component for displaying details of a specific card.
.Card.js: Component for rendering individual cards.
.Header.js: Component for the header of the application.




## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the Moonpig React App showcases essential features, there are exciting plans to enhance and expand the application If time permit:

### 1.Search Bar 

-  search bar , allowing users to explore and purchase Easily.

### 2. Category Filtering and Sorting

- Implement advanced filtering options, enabling users to sort and filter cards based on categories, making it easier to find the perfect card for any occasion.

### 3. Multi-Image Scrolling

- the EachCardPage component to support scrolling through multiple images for each card, providing users with a comprehensive view of the product.

### 4. Dynamic Pricing Based on Size

- Enable users to choose different sizes for cards, with dynamic pricing that adjusts based on the selected size. This feature adds flexibility and personalization to the card purchasing experience.

### 5. Shopping Basket and Database Integration

- Introduce a shopping basket feature where users can add cards to their cart, review their selections, and proceed to checkout. 

### 6. Stylistic Improvements

- Dedicate additional time to refine the visual appearance of the application. Focus on improving overall aesthetics, ensuring a delightful and user-friendly interface.

### 7. Blog Post 

- Introduce a blog post section within the application, allowing users to share experiences, insights, and recommendations related to their card purchases. Foster a sense of community engagement.


### 8. Clean Code and Documentation

- Continuously improve code quality, adhering to best coding practices. Enhance documentation to facilitate easier contribution and collaboration.

### Notes

I appreciate you looking at my code and giving me a chance.

# Frontend Technical Challenge

We've been asked to rebuild the Moonpig website using the latest best practices and you are part of a team working on the proof of concept. We'd like you to build out a simple page which will display a list of cards that a customer can buy using our API.

It should meet the following use cases:

> As a customer I can view a list of available cards on my mobile, tablet and desktop so that I can celebrate my new job

> As a customer I can view more details of a card so that I can decide it's the right card for me before purchase

## Wireframes

### Card Listings Page

### Card Details Page

Possible ideas for extension are the ability to search, routing, pagination, responsive images and animation. However, doing less "well" is preferable to doing more "less well" ðŸ˜‰. We also appreciate that your free time is important. Therefore if you feel your code is unfinished please leave some notes in your README.md explaining what you would do next given more time. We are more than happy to review this.

## API

### Search Cards

```
curl "https://moonpig.github.io/tech-test-frontend/search.json"
```

> Note: static data has been used here to ensure consistency - please treat this as if it were an API call

### View Card

```
curl "https://moonpig.github.io/tech-test-frontend/product/pu041d.json"
```

> Note: replace `pu041d` with the variable `MoonpigProductNo` from the first API call

Something which is likely to catch you out will be the CORS restrictions imposed by the browser, you can use something along the lines of https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/#client in order to work around this restriction.

## Tools, libraries and frameworks

At Moonpig we are heavily invested in React and its surrounding ecosystem. Therefore when completing the exercise we would like to see you use React if you are going to use a framework.

Primarily we will be looking at the application code itself - so it's fine to use something like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) or [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap your build. But if tooling is your thing, there's bonus points for rolling your own build system with Webpack, Babel etc.

It should be possible to statically host the application and it would be great to see it hosted on something like GitHub Pages or AWS S3.

## Testing

At Moonpig we put a big emphasis on automated testing, and so it's important that you consider this as part of your submission.  Please think about what behaviour is important to test, and how to test it.  We use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) but feel free to use other libraries.

## Assessment

We will assess the task based on the following criteria:

- How clean, modular and extensible the code is
- How it looks visually and the techniques used to style the application
- Responsive web design techniques used
- Accessibility
- Approach to testing
- Anything that goes above and beyond
